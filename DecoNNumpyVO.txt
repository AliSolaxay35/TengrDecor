DecoNNumpyVO.txt

This File Contains A Python Decorator Named "normalize_output", Saved In "DecoNNumpyVO.py".

The Decorator Automatically Normalizes The Output Vector Of The Decorated Function Using L2 Norm.

If The Output Vector Has Zero Length, It Returns The Original Vector To Avoid Division By Zero.

This Is Useful In Machine Learning Or Vector Operations Where Normalized Output Is Needed.

Example:

@normalize_output
def get_random_vector():
    return np.random.rand(3)

The Output Will Be A Unit Vector With The Same Direction As The Original Random Vector.

Thank You.
