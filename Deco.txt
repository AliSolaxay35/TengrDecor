Deco.py

This Python Module Demonstrates A Simple Decorator Named "run_on_zoj".

The Decorator Executes The Decorated Function Only If The Current Minute Is Even.  
If The Minute Is Odd, It Prints "hisss" Instead Of Running The Function.

Two Example Functions Are Decorated:  
- say_hello() Prints A Greeting  
- say_bye() Prints A Farewell

When Run, The Decorator Checks The Minute And Decides Whether To Execute The Function Or Not.

This Is A Basic Example Of Using Decorators For Conditional Function Execution.

Thank You.
