DecoCNumpyMS.txt

This File Contains A Python Decorator Named "check_shape" Saved In "DecoCNumpyMS.py".

The Decorator Checks If The Input Matrix Has The Expected Shape Before Running The Function.

If The Matrix Shape Does Not Match The Expected Shape, It Raises A ValueError.

This Helps Prevent Errors By Ensuring The Function Receives Correct Input.

Example:

@check_shape((2, 2))
def determinant(mat):
    ...

When Called With A 2x2 Matrix, The Function Calculates Its Determinant.

If The Input Matrix Shape Is Different, An Error Is Raised.

Thank You.
