DecoMemoizationCache.txt

This File Contains A Python Decorator Named "memoize", Saved In "DecoMemoizationCache.py".

The Decorator Implements Memoization By Storing Previous Results In A Cache Dictionary.

When The Decorated Function Is Called With The Same Argument Again,  
The Cached Result Is Returned Without Recomputing.

Example:

@memoize
def expensive_computation(x):
    ...

Calling The Function Twice With The Same Input Shows That The Second Call Uses Cached Value.

Memoization Helps Optimize Expensive Or Recursive Computations.

Thank You.
