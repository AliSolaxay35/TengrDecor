DecoLog.txt

This File Contains A Simple Python Decorator Named "log_decorator", Saved In The File "DecoLog.py".

The Purpose Of This Decorator Is To Print The Name Of The Function Before It Runs.

It Helps Track Which Function Is Being Executed, Which Can Be Useful For Debugging Or Understanding Code Behavior.

Example:

@log_decorator
def add(a, b):
    return a + b

Calling This Function Will Print:

Running Function: add

Then It Returns The Result Normally.

The Decorator Is Basic, But Shows How You Can Wrap And Extend Function Behavior In Python.

Thank You.
