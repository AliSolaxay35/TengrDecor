DecoTimer.txt

This File Contains A Simple Python Decorator Named "timer", Saved In "DecoTimer.py".

The Purpose Of This Decorator Is To Measure How Long A Function Takes To Run.

It Records The Start Time, Runs The Function, Then Calculates And Prints The Execution Time In Seconds.

Example:

@timer
def compute():
    total = sum(range(10**6))
    return total

When You Call compute(), It Will Print Something Like:

Execution Time: 0.0453 Seconds

This Type Of Decorator Is Useful For Performance Testing And Optimization.
